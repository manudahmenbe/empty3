When you build with maven tool, assuming you have
correctly set jdk home and exe path, and maven
too, internet connection, space disk and memory
size enough... However your build will fail.

Because.
The explanation is that the pom.xml contains
a signing key in gpg plugin build section
of pom.xml descriptor. You can't sign against
me. It would not be fair ðŸ˜ƒ.

You can delete the sign clause and replace by yours
or nope.

If you miss a property check this

Or make a new issue.
